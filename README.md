Yet another simple implementation of lisp in java.
Wrote this for purely academic purposes.
All suggestions are welcome.

TODO:
1) Implement a sample function -- DONE: addition, string concatenation
2) Make functions pluggable, refactor code
3) Add basic mathematical functions (subtraction, multi, division)
4) Support for multiple numeric types (integer and float)
5) Add boolean functions (and, or, not)
6) Add comparision functions (>, <, ==)
